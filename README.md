## **Objective**  
- Identify **monthly, yearly, and seasonal sales trends**.  
- Calculate key business metrics like **Total Sales, Profit Margins, and Growth Rate**.  
- Analyze **regional sales performance** and **shipping efficiency**.  
- Visualize findings using **Power BI dashboards**.  

## **Tools & Technologies Used**  
- **Python**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn (for data cleaning & analysis).  
- **Power BI**: For interactive dashboards and data visualization.  
- **DAX**: Used to create dynamic calculations in Power BI.  
- **Power Query**: For data transformation and ETL processing.  

## 📊 **Data Analysis Steps**  
1. **Data Extraction & Cleaning**:  
   - Loaded dataset into Python for preprocessing.  
   - Handled missing values, corrected date formats, and ensured data consistency.  
   
2. **Sales Trends Analysis**:  
   - Used Python for exploratory data analysis (EDA).  
   - Created time series visualizations for sales performance over different periods.  
   
3. **KPIs & Performance Metrics**:  
   - Computed **Total Revenue, Profit, Order-to-Ship Time, and Regional Performance**.  
   - Identified high-selling products and regions.  
   
4. **Shipping Performance Analysis**:  
   - Measured shipping time by comparing **Order Date vs. Ship Date**.  
   - Used DAX in Power BI to calculate **average shipping duration**.  
   
5. **Visualization & Reporting**:  
   - Created an interactive **Power BI dashboard**.  
   - Used bar charts, line graphs, and KPIs to display insights effectively.  

## **Results & Insights**  
- 📈 **Sales Trends**: Identified peak sales months and seasonal patterns.  
- 🌍 **Regional Insights**: Found top-performing regions contributing to maximum revenue.  
- 🚚 **Shipping Delays**: Highlighted areas where delivery delays impacted customer satisfaction.  
- 📊 **Dashboard Reporting**: Enabled easy decision-making with interactive visualizations.
